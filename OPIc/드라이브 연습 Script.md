# You indicated in survey you like to drive. When do you usually enjoy driving? Why do you like to drive? Who do you like to drive with? Tell me all in as much detail as possible.

[개요] 맞아. 드라이브를 좋아하지. 특히 아내와 강아지를 데리고 하는 드라이브를 좋아해.

[언제] 보통 주말에 드라이브를 많이 가. 

[이유] 좋아. 이제 이유에 대해서 생각을 해보자고. Actually, I have a bunch of driving experiences and really enjoyed it, but I have never thought about why I like driving so much like this? 주로 드라이브를 갈 때 해변가가 첫 번째 옵션이야. 넓은 바다를 볼 수 있는 곳. 그 곳에 가면 해방감(feel free)을 느껴.
