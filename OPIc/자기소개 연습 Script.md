[인사말] Hi Eva. Nice to meet you.  

[이름, 나이] My name is Jaemin Lee and you can just call me Jaemin. Or call me whatever you want. I'm 31 years old.  

[결혼 여부] I got married and living with my wife. My house is in Dongtan and it's pretty close to Suwon, the test site!  
And there is also one more family member: our dog. Her name is Yoolmoo, 1-year old puppy! She is really cute. I feel my heart is breaking cuz I cannot show her to you right now. 

[오픽을 보는 이유] I am here for job application, it requires a verification of English skill. That's why I'm taking this OPIC test today. Wish me a good luck!  

[마무리] Well, this was introducing of myself and I hope I have more oppertunity to tell about myself after this talk. I mean, maybe next question? Nice to meet you again Eva. Thanks.
