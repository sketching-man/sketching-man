# I would like to know where you live. Describe your house in detail. What does it look like? How many rooms do you have?

[위치] I think I need to tell you where my house is located first. My house is at Dongtan, a city near the Seoul. It maybe will take about an hour if you take a bus to get Seoul from here.  

[집 구조] And my house is in the apartment. It's on the 8th floor.

[방 갯수] It has 3 rooms in total, and kitchen, and two toilets and of course, living room is also exists. My wife and I usually takes time in this living room, watching Youtube or some series, so on.

[방 용도] I told you that my house has 3 rooms, and one of them is for sleeping. So we hanged a very thick curtain to block the sunlight from a window. We usually change our clothes in this place, so closets containing clothes are near here.  
Then, two rooms are remaining. One is for my wife, and another is for me. We decorated our rooms with our taste. For example, my wife hanged a wallpaper that shows really beautiful scenary of nature. I designed all my interiors of my room in black color. We usually do some computer stuffs, like video games, watching Youtube, or something else. Of course we try to do our studies for improving our skills.


# I would like to know where you live. Which is your favorite room at home? What does it look like? What do you mostly do there?

[어디?] 침실을 제일 좋아한다. 

[이유?] 내가 사랑하는 것들이 몇 가지 있는데, 그 중 제일은 내 아내, 그리고 그 다음이 푹 쉬는 것. Taking a deep rest? 침실은 이 모든걸 만족시키는 멋진 공간. satisfies all these requirements.

[뭘 하지?] 잠 자는게 일단 제일 많고, 누워서 휴대폰 하는 것, 아내와 넷플릭스 보기. 아, 알지는 모르겠지만, 요새 닌텐도 스위치라고 좋은 gaming console이 있다구. when u put this in the dock, connected with TV, then it becomes a video game console with TV. and when you pull it off and grab in your hand, it has its own screen and you can play it while you carry it. 누워서 이런 게임을 하는 것도 좋아. 날 웃게 만들지.
