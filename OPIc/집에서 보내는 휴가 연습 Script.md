# Who do you want to meet when you spend your vacation at home? Why do you want to meet that person?.

[가족, 아내]


[만약 굳이 누군가를 만나야 한다면, 집에서 쉬면서 집 앞 카페에서 친구 만나러 잠깐 나가는 정도]


# Tell me some of the things you would like to do with people you visit or see during your vacation. Describe in detail.

[집 근처에서 잠시 만나서 chat. 밥을 먹으면 best ]
I prefer to meet some friends or family not far from my house. Cuz all people I know lives all around!
Eating some meals would be the best option for me, when meeting them. Lunch or dinner doesn't matter!
If we're not having meal, then I think I'd take them to a cafe having really nice mood and then we talk a lot.
I loves to talk with someone I love. I usually spend over couple of hours when I meet someone and just chatting each other.

[그게 아니라면 만나서 영화를 보는 것도 좋을 것 같아.]
Or, I think I have already told you that my hobby is watching some movies.
So, my second option would taking them to movie theater and watching a movie that all of us can enjoy.


# Tell me about the last time you spent your vacation at home. How did your vacation start and end? What did you do? Did you meet someone? Describe everything that you did for me.
